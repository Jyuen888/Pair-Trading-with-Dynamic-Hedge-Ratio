# Pair Trading with Dynamic Hedge Ratio
In this project, we demonstrate how a pair trading with dynamic hedge ratio can significantly increase the returns of this strategy.

We use state space model, i.e. the Kalman Filter to update the hedge ratio for each trading day, providing us with a less-noisy and more directionally accurate signals.

We also provide a brief introduction and the derivation of some of the parameters used for the Kalman Filter system.
